# Health Care Model

## Introduction
This repository contains analysis and exploration of a healthcare dataset using Python. The project leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Overview
The project involves:
- Loading and exploring the healthcare dataset.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Descriptive statistics and insights.
- Visualization of key metrics and trends.

## Dataset
This dataset contains information about patients admitted to a hospital, including demographic details, medical conditions, treatments, and billing information. The dataset comprises the following columns:

Name: Names of the patients admitted to the hospital.
Age: Age of the patients at the time of admission.
Gender: Gender of the patients (e.g., male, female).
Blood Type: Blood type of the patients.
Medical Condition: Description of the medical condition or diagnosis for which the patient is admitted.
Date of Admission: Date when the patient was admitted to the hospital.
Doctor: Name or identifier of the doctor responsible for the patient's care.
Hospital: Name or identifier of the hospital where the patient is admitted.
Insurance Provider: Name of the insurance provider covering the patient's medical expenses.
Billing Amount: Amount billed to the patient or their insurance provider for medical services received during the hospital stay.
Room Number: Identifier of the room where the patient is accommodated.
Admission Type: Type of admission, such as emergency, elective, or transfer.
Discharge Date: Date when the patient was discharged from the hospital.
Medication: List of medications prescribed to the patient during their hospitalization.
Test Results: Results of medical tests conducted on the patient during their hospital stay.

This dataset provides valuable insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment patterns, and hospital operations. It can be used for various analyses, including patient outcome prediction, resource allocation optimization, and healthcare quality improvement initiatives.
